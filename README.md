### **Assignment: Building an Interactive and Dynamic Web Page**  

#### **Objective**  
Create a visually engaging and interactive webpage that utilizes **CSS3 transitions and animations**, **advanced JavaScript functions** (including scope, parameters, and return values), and combines **CSS animations with JavaScript** to create dynamic user interactions.  

---

### **Part 1: CSS3 Transitions and Animations**  
1. **Task**:  
   - Use **CSS transitions** to create smooth effects on hover or focus (e.g., buttons that change color or grow).  
   - Use **CSS animations** with `@keyframes` to create dynamic effects like fading, sliding, or rotating.  

2. **Requirements**:  
   - At least **two elements** must include hover or focus transitions.  
   - At least **two animations** must be created using `@keyframes` (e.g., an animated banner or an animated loading spinner).

### **Part 2: JavaScript Functions**  
1. **Task**:  
   - Write JavaScript functions to handle interactivity on the webpage.  
   - Utilize **parameters**, **return values**, and demonstrate an understanding of **scope**.  

2. **Requirements**:  
   - Write at least **three functions**:  
     - A function with parameters and return values (e.g., calculate a value like the area of a rectangle based on user input).  
     - A function that demonstrates the concept of scope (local vs. global variables).  
     - A function to toggle a CSS class that applies an animation (e.g., toggling a "hidden" class for a modal).  

---

### **Part 3: Combining CSS Animations with JavaScript**  
1. **Task**:  
   - Use JavaScript to trigger or control CSS animations dynamically.  

2. **Requirements**:  
   - Create an interactive element (e.g., a button, card, or slider) that triggers an animation when clicked.  
   - Dynamically add or remove CSS classes to control the animation.  
   - Ensure that the animation resets properly when triggered multiple times.
